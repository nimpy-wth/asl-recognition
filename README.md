# Real-Time American Sign Language Recognition
241-202 MACHINE LEARNING II - 2/67

## Overview
This project is a real-time American Sign Language (ASL) recognition system using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Mediapipe Hand Tracking. The model predicts ASL signs based on hand landmark and supports word formation and suggestions.

## Features
- Real-time ASL Recognition using a webcam
- Hand Landmark Detection with Mediapipe
- CNN-Based Prediction Model for classification
- Word Formation & Auto-Suggestion
- Live Display of predictions with OpenCV
